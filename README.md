# Phone Directory — Binary Search Tree (BST) + Tests

A simple phone directory implemented in C++.  
Contacts are stored in-memory using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for efficient insert/search/delete operations.  
The repository also includes unit tests / test code to verify correctness of the BST and directory functions.

---

## Features

- ➕ **Add Contact** — Insert a new contact (name + phone number) into the directory.  
- 🔎 **Search Contact** — Fast lookup by contact name using BST search.  
- ❌ **Delete Contact** — Remove a contact from the directory while maintaining BST properties.  
- 📜 **List Contacts** — In-order traversal to display contacts in sorted order (by name).  
- ✅ **Tests** — Test files / test cases to validate BST operations and directory behavior.

## Requirements

- **Language:** C++ (C++98 or later recommended)  
- **Compiler / IDE:** GCC, Clang, MSVC, or Code::Blocks  
- **Platform:** Windows / Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
